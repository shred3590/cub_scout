	<h1>Pack 198</h1>
	<p>Pack 198 has been in continuous existence from shortly after the school opened in the 1950s.  It has developed a rich tradition of a welcoming pack with a tight community between the kids and their parents.  There are many possible events for the boys to participate in, although none of them are required.  Our goal to provide a fun, safe environment where the boys learn the valuable life lessons taught through the Cub Scout and Boy Scout programs.  We hope this site provides a valuable resource about the pack.</p>
	<p>If you want more information about the pack or wish to contact us for any reason, please fill out the contact form and we will get in contact with you as soon as possible.</p>
