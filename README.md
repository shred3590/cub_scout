Pack 198 Web Site

This site is for Cub Scout Pack 198 in Portland, Oregon.  
This is also a portfolio site where I will try out new techniques that I am learning about.  

Plans for the future:
Refactor the page to use the Slim framework and Twig for templating.
Implement registration for parents of scouts.
Use registration information to create roster.
Allow registered users to upload photos.
Program site to automatically update photos to recent uploads with exclusion for kids without parental consent.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments.  

The site is currently live at http://vetsrights.com.  We will be migrating it to the Pack site as soon as we have the server information.
