	<h1>Cub Scout Summer Camps</h1>
	<p>Summer camp is one of the highlights fo the Cub Scout program.  The Cascade Pacific Council has some of the <a href="http://www.cpcbsa.org/camping/camp-properties" target="_blank">premire camps</a> in the entire country and the boys look forward to exploring a new property each year as they progress through the Cub Scout experience.</p>
	<p>The camp program begins with new Wolf Cubs attending <a href="http://www.cpcbsa.org/camping/camp-properties/ireland" target="_blank">Camp Ireland</a>.  It is a day program located in Hillsboro near Glenco High School.</p>
	<p>The new Bear Cubs attend Cub World at <a href="http://www.cpcbsa.org/camping/camp-properties/scouters-mountain" target="_blank">Scouter's Mountain</a>.  It is a three day, two night program that gives the boys their first taste of overnight camp.  It is a unique camp where the boys sleep in railroad cars, tee pees, or a fort.</p>
